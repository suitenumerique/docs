# Installation with docker compose

We provide a sample configuration for running Docs using Docker Compose. Please note that this configuration is experimental, and the official way to deploy Docs in production is to use [k8s](../installation/k8s.md)

## Requirements

- A modern version of Docker and its Compose plugin.
- A domain name and DNS configured to your server.
- An Identity Provider that supports OpenID Connect protocol - we provide [an example to deploy Keycloak](../examples/compose/keycloak/README.md).
- An Object Storage that implements S3 API - we provide [an example to deploy Minio](../examples/compose/minio/README.md).
- A Postgresql database - we provide [an example in the compose file](../examples/compose/compose.yaml).
- A Redis database - we provide [an example in the compose file](../examples/compose/compose.yaml).

## Software Requirements

Ensure you have Docker Compose(v2) installed on your host server. Follow the official guidelines for a reliable setup:

Docker Compose is included with Docker Engine:

- **Docker Engine:** We suggest adhering to the instructions provided by Docker
  for [installing Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

For older versions of Docker Engine that do not include Docker Compose:

- **Docker Compose:** Install it as per the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

> [!NOTE]
> `docker-compose` may not be supported. You are advised to use `docker compose` instead.

## Step 1: Prepare your working environment:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/env.d
curl -o compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitenumerique/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/examples/compose/compose.yaml
curl -o env.d/common https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitenumerique/docs/refs/heads/main/env.d/production.dist/common
curl -o env.d/backend https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitenumerique/docs/refs/heads/main/env.d/production.dist/backend
curl -o env.d/yprovider https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitenumerique/docs/refs/heads/main/env.d/production.dist/yprovider
curl -o env.d/common https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitenumerique/docs/refs/heads/main/env.d/production.dist/postgresql
```

## Step 2: Configuration

Docs configuration is achieved through environment variables. We provide a [detailed description of all variables](../env.md).

In this example, we assume the following services:

- OIDC provider on https://id.yourdomain.tld
- Object Storage on https://storage.yourdomain.tld
- Docs on https://docs.yourdomain.tld
- Bucket name is docs-media-storage

**Set your own values in `env.d/common`**

### OIDC

Authentication in Docs is managed through Open ID Connect protocol. A functional Identity Provider implementing this protocol is required.

For guidance, refer to our [Keycloak deployment example](../examples/compose/keycloak/README.md).

If using Keycloak as your Identity Provider, set `OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID` and `OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET` variables with those of the OIDC client created for Docs. By default we have set `docs` as the realm name, if you have named your realm differently, update the value `REALM_NAME` in `env.d/common`

For others OIDC providers, update the variables in `env.d/backend`.

### Object Storage

Files and media are stored in an Object Store that supports the S3 API.

For guidance, refer to our [Minio deployment example](../examples/compose/minio/README.md).

Set `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the credentials of a user with `readwrite` access to the bucket created for Docs.

### Postgresql

Docs uses PostgreSQL as its database. Although an external PostgreSQL can be used, our example provides a deployment method.

If you are using the example provided, you need to generate a secure key for `DB_PASSWORD` and set it in `env.d/postgresql`. 

If you are using an external service or not using our default values, you should update the variables in `env.d/postgresql`

### Redis

Docs uses Redis for caching. While an external Redis can be used, our example provides a deployment method.

If you are using an external service, you need to set `REDIS_URL` environment variable in `env.d/backend`.

### Y Provider

The Y provider service enables collaboration through websockets.

Generates a secure key for `Y_PROVIDER_API_KEY` and `COLLABORATION_SERVER_SECRET` in ``env.d/yprovider``. 

### Docs

The Docs backend is built on the Django Framework.

Generates a secure key for `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` in `env.d/backend`. 

### Logging

Update the following variables in `env.d/backend` if you want to change the logging levels:
```env
LOGGING_LEVEL_HANDLERS_CONSOLE=DEBUG
LOGGING_LEVEL_LOGGERS_ROOT=DEBUG
LOGGING_LEVEL_LOGGERS_APP=DEBUG
```

### Mail

The following environment variables are required in `env.d/backend` for the mail service to send invitations :

```env
DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST=<smtp host> 
DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_USER=<smtp user> 
DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<smtp password>
DJANGO_EMAIL_PORT=<smtp port> 
DJANGO_EMAIL_FROM=<your email address>

#DJANGO_EMAIL_USE_TLS=true # A flag to enable or disable TLS for email sending.
#DJANGO_EMAIL_USE_SSL=true # A flag to enable or disable SSL for email sending.


DJANGO_EMAIL_BRAND_NAME=<brand name used in email templates> # e.g. "La Suite Num√©rique"
DJANGO_EMAIL_LOGO_IMG=<logo image to use in email templates.> # e.g. "https://docs.yourdomain.tld/assets/logo-suite-numerique.png" 
```

### AI

Built-in AI actions let users generate, summarize, translate, and correct content.

AI is disabled by default. To enable it, the following environment variables must be set in in `env.d/backend`:

```env
AI_FEATURE_ENABLED=true # is false by default
AI_BASE_URL=https://openaiendpoint.com
AI_API_KEY=<API key>
AI_MODEL=<model used> e.g. llama
```

### Frontend theme

You can [customize your Docs instance](../theming.md) with your own theme and custom css.

The following environment variables must be set in `env.d/backend`:

```env
FRONTEND_THEME=default # name of your theme built with cuningham
FRONTEND_CSS_URL=https://storage.yourdomain.tld/themes/custom.css # custom css
```

## Step 3: Reverse proxy and SSL/TLS

> [!WARNING]
> In a production environment, configure SSL/TLS termination to run your instance on https.

If you have your own certificates and proxy setup, you can skip this part.

You can follow our [nginx proxy example](../examples/compose/nginx-proxy/README.md) with automatic generation and renewal of certificate with Let's Encrypt. 

You will need to uncomment the environment and network sections in compose file and update it with your values.

```yaml
  frontend:
    ...
    # Uncomment and set your values if using our nginx proxy example
    #environment:
    # - VIRTUAL_HOST=${DOCS_HOST} # used by nginx proxy 
    # - VIRTUAL_PORT=8083 # used by nginx proxy
    # - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=${DOCS_HOST} # used by lets encrypt to generate TLS certificate
    ...
# Uncomment if using our nginx proxy example
#    networks:
#    - proxy-tier
#
#networks:
#  proxy-tier:
#    external: true
```

## Step 4: Start Docs

You are ready to start your Docs application !

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
> [!NOTE]
> Version of the images are set to latest, you should pin it to the desired version to avoid unwanted upgrades when pulling latest image.

## Step 5: Run the database migration and create Django admin user

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py migrate
docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py createsuperuser --email <admin email> --password <admin password>
```

Replace `<admin email>` with the email of your admin user and generate a secure password. 

Your docs instance is now available on the domain you defined, https://docs.yourdomain.tld.

THe admin interface is available on https://docs.yourdomain.tld/admin with the admin user you just created.

## How to upgrade your Docs application

Before running an upgrade you must check the [Upgrade document](../../UPGRADE.md) for specific procedures that might be needed.

You can also check the [Changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md) for brief summary of the changes.

### Step 1: Edit the images tag with the desired version

### Step 2: Pull the images

```bash
docker compose pull
```

### Step 3: Restart your containers

```bash
docker compose restart
```

### Step 4: Run the database migration
Your database schema may need to be updated, run:
```bash
docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py migrate
```
