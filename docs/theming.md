# Runtime Theming üé®

### How to Use

To use this feature, simply set the `FRONTEND_CSS_URL` environment variable to the URL of your custom CSS file. For example:

```javascript
FRONTEND_CSS_URL=http://anything/custom-style.css
```

Once you've set this variable, our application will load your custom CSS file and apply the styles to our frontend application.

### Benefits

This feature provides several benefits, including:

*   **Easy customization** üîÑ: With this feature, you can easily customize the look and feel of our application without requiring any code changes.
*   **Flexibility** üåà: You can use any CSS styles you like to create a custom theme that meets your needs.
*   **Runtime theming** ‚è±Ô∏è: This feature allows you to change the theme of our application at runtime, without requiring a restart or recompilation.

### Example Use Case

Let's say you want to change the background color of our application to a custom color. You can create a custom CSS file with the following contents:

```css
body {
  background-color: #3498db;
}
```

Then, set the `FRONTEND_CSS_URL` environment variable to the URL of your custom CSS file. Once you've done this, our application will load your custom CSS file and apply the styles, changing the background color to the custom color you specified.

# **Custom Export Templates** üìÑ

You can define custom export templates to add introductory content, such as headers or titles, to documents before exporting them as PDF, Docx, etc...

Export Templates are managed through the admin interface and can be selected by users during the export process.

### Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Currently, templates are only prepended to the document.
More complex layouts are not supported at this time.
- The `CSS` and `Description` fields are being ignored at this time.
- <b>Due to technical conversion limitations, not all HTML can be converted to the internal format!</b>

### How to Use
